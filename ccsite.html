    <h1>Companion Cowork</h1>
  </header>
  <p>This Coworking website was created as an example mockup for a "local coworking space". For this piece, I went with a coworking space that is a little more modern and contemporary and stuck with color scheme to match. </p>

    <h1>Additional Elements</h1>

  <p> For the color scheme, I went with a nice warm orange and a deep blue to stick with a more modern color palette to match the contemporary style of the coworking location I was portraying. After deciding on this palette, I created a logo that played off of the fact that the buisness had a name where both words began with a "C". I wanted a logo that worked well paired with typography and also as a standalone logo with just the double "C". I researched other coworking sites to get a feel for the space that I was working in, and came up with concepts based on those inspirations. I went with icons and elements that clearly conveyed different services and made sure to inform the reader as to why they should choose Companion Cowork.</p>
